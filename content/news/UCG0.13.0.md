# Patch Notes

## Added / Removed

- Added AOE keyword and added it to AOE cards.

- New cards: "Sear", "Searing Blade" and "Composure".

- New relic: "Discarded Power".

- Added Shield keyword to cards that didn't have it but applied shield.

## Edits

- Cards opened from a card pack are now ordered descendingly by rarity in the pack opening panel.

- The card "Insight" is no longer classified as Instant.

- Updated the card "Mana Essence" to be a defense card.

- Decreased the maximum power roll of the card "Wild Swing" from **1-3** to **1-2**

- Decreased the maximum power roll of the card "Gambit" from **1-3** to **1-2**

- Updated the "Exhaust" keyword description slightly.

- Removed the card "Mana Essence" from the "Spell Pack".

- Made ally units gained from the "Hire Ally" run modifier to use the Knight sprite for now.

## Fixes

- Fixed an issue where the effect of the card "Trick" could stick around for multiple turns.

- Fixed an issue where if you traded relics in and received a relic that's available for purchase in the shop, and the player had enough money to purchase said relic, the player could end up with duplicate relics.

- Fixed an issue where the card "Healing Spell" was unavailable to be acquired.
