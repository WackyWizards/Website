Most of this week was spent refactoring some internal systems, so I haven't had much time to add new content. Nevertheless these refactors were much needed, and they allow us for example to add more complex card or action effects. Work will return to content real soon, my sincerest apologies.

There might be some bugs I missed in regards to the new way some cards apply their effects. If you run into any, you may report them to us on the [discord server](https://www.wackywizards.org/discord) or on the s&box forum for the game [here](https://sbox.game/spoonstuff/card_game/forum)

Any exceptions *(errors)* thrown by the game are auto-reported to us by s&box, so no need to report those as much, but you can if you wish by giving us more info on how you ran into it.

# Patch Notes

## Added / Removed

- Added a tooltip to hidden items in the collection that tells the player where said item is available to be unlocked from.

## Edits

- Updated and improved the way the camera controller works in battle. Now, moving the camera around should feel slightly more responsive, and it will not return to the center again.

- Updated the availability of the relic "Last Light" to be available only via trading. Was previously available in the shop.

- Cards displayed in a card pack are now ordered by rarity in descending order, they were previously ordered ascending.

## Fixes

- Fixed an issue where the card "Trick" didn't have the "instant" keyword.
