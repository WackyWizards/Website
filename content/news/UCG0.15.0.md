Hiya! It's Ellie. You might have noticed last week that there was no weekly update. That's because I'm stopping weekly updates until I have something substantial to add to the game. If there's an empty week where I didn't have enough time to work on the game, or don't have a lot to add, it will be skipped.

I hope that with this change I can try to keep the schedule somewhat alive, while still feeling that every update does *something* to the game.

For this update, I managed to wrangle myself to fix an oversight I left in the code, and add 9 new relics. This brings us up to 35 relics in the game, and 40 collectible cards.

My goal is still to reach over 100 cards and 50 relics, with tons of different build ideas and strategies. I still want to also touch upon a lot of the current effects, to make builds flow better. That's an issue I have with the gameplay right now that I hope to touch upon soon. Right now I've just been adding new things to fill out the numbers, and then I will probably do a big overhaul of a lot of them later on.

I might probably take two or three weeks break here from weekly updates to work on a bigger V0.16.0 update. I don't know yet. We'll see.
