Another small update today. This last week has been hectic, and it looks like my life won't be getting any more unhectic for a bit, so things might be slow for a while, sorry.. :/

# Patch Notes

## Edits

- Updated the cost of the card **"Expand Mind"** to **2**, was **1**.

- Updated the rarity "Epic" on Relics to be "Legendary" instead.

- Hopefully made the background text on the keyword panel to be slightly more visible.

## Fixes

- Fixed an issue where the passive "Starved for Blood"'s targeting effect did not work as intended.

- Fixed an issue where AOE cards could activate on the same unit twice.
