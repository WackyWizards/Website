I will from now on be publishing untitled card game updates every **wednesday** after the weekly s&box update, if I have something to add to the game.

This update post and any subsequent ones will contain spoilers. Spoilers have been marked with spoiler tags which you may click to reveal. You have been warned.

With that said, here's some patch notes!

# Patch Notes

## Added / Removed

- Added the run shop with 4 helpful run modifiers. You can earn gold by completing floors, dealing damage and getting kills.

Dev note: This update brings the initial implementation, but further balancing is planned.

- Added a new reworked beastiary in the last update. It is now available on the main menu from the "Beastiary" tab.

- Added a new boss battle to ||floor 1||.

- Added a new boss enemy, ||"Copycat"||, to the aforementioned boss battle.

- Added ||"Materialize"|| card.

- Added ||"Speed Potion"|| card.

- Added ||"Glass Cannon"|| card.

Dev note: This card is a part of this update but might not be fully done yet, so it might be updated in the future.

- Added stats for killing the various enemies in the game. This isn't displayed anywhere in-game yet but allows us to track kills of various types.

## Edits

- Updated the passive ability ||"Starved For Blood"|| for the units ||Zombie|| and ||Elite Zombie||.

Dev note: Previously, you could win battles by not doing anything with the previous iteration of this passive. Of course, that isn't really fun or interesting. So now we've revised it a bit to hopefully make it a bit more interesting.

- Updated the effect of the card "Sleight-Of-Hand" to exhaust itself after drawing.

Dev note: This update is to prevent using the card to quickly draw your entire deck with one card in one turn. Of course we aren't ruling out being able to do this via other cards and other builds, but it is not the intended design for this one.

- Buffed the HP healing effect of the card "Gambit" to 2 *(was 1)*.

- The map key info panel now starts unhidden by default. Press the button on the bottom right of the map panel to toggle it's visibility.

## Fixes

- Fixed and re-enabled AOE cards ||(Enchanted Blast, Swipe)||.

- Fixed an issue where the deck would have 3 hidden cards in it from the start.

- Fixed an issue where the relic reward from beating elite battles would include relics the player already owns.

- Fixed an issue where the received cards panel from opening a card pack weren't fully centered.

- Logic fixes for drawing and exhausting cards.

- Logic fixes for card slots and targeting arrows.
