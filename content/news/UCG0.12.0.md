# Patch Notes

## Added / Removed

- Added run difficulties up to tier 5. Unlock the next higher difficulty by completing a full run with the previous lower unlocked tier. The game gets progressively more difficult per tier.

Dev note: These difficulties aren't final, and will be tweaked a bunch in the coming updates.

- Added ||"Quickstep"|| card.

- Added ||"Iron Coin"|| relic.

- Added click sounds to buttons in the beastiary that lacked them.

## Edits

- Card actions in battle now display the modified value. Green if the power value is higher than base, red if the value is lower than the base power of the action.

- Edited the effect of the relic "Last Light"; upon activation it now also inflicts 1 Fragile to the afflicted unit.

- Edited the effect of the relic "Fate's Favor"; upon activation it now also draws 1 card.

- Slightly reworded the descriptions of the following status effects: "Protection", "Fragile", "Burn", "Bleed", "Enchantment".

- Changed the name of the status effect "Enchanted" to "Enchantment".

- Increased the size of status effect icons slightly in battle to hopefully make them more visible.

- Updated run modifier shop item texts.

- Disabled the ability to crit for now.

Dev note: Will be re-enabled once it's more clear and has more impact on the actual game.

## Fixes

- Fixed an issue where the "Unequipped Relics" warning would show if the player has only always active relics.
