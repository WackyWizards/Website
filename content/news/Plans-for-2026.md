Hi everyone! First of all, thank you for being with us throughout 2025.

On a personal level, 2025 hasn’t been the kindest year for me. Still, being able to do what I love and spend time with some truly awesome people has meant the world to me.

The small community we’ve managed to build is genuinely special, and I couldn’t be happier.

As we head into 2026, I want to keep building both the organization and our community. I already have tons of ideas for the year ahead, and I want to use this post to talk about some of them in a bit more detail.

# Our Projects

## Observation

Observation is a clone of the *I'm on Observation Duty* franchise by Notovia.

I made the game in about a week, and it was a lot of fun to work on. While it started as a clone, I’d really like to build on it and turn it into something more unique over time.

For now, it’s on the back burner as the rest of the team and I focus our efforts on other projects, but it’s absolutely something I want to return to later in 2026.

## Untitled Card Game

Untitled Card Game started life in 2025 and is inspired by a bunch of different games that I really love.

I think it’s in a solid starting place. While it’s definitely rough around the edges and far from perfect, it *is* playable, and you can already get a feel for the direction it’s heading in.

I plan to keep working on UCG throughout 2026. It’s the kind of game I’d personally enjoy playing in my free time, and I’ve already received a lot of great feedback from community members and friends that I want to build on.

You can also expect weekly updates to continue, at least through the early part of the new year.

## Unannounced Wacky Wizards Project

You might have heard me mention that we’re also working on a new currently secret unannounced project.

While I can’t share much just yet (it’s still very early in development), I *can* confirm that yes, we are working on something new, and it’s currently planned to be announced sometime in 2026.

Please keep an eye out. I think it's really cool.

# Wacky Wizards

In early 2025, I decided to go all in on Wacky Wizards.

If the future allows, my eventual goal is to work on Wacky Wizards full-time, and ideally bring on others full-time as well. I want this to be a place where we can sustainably make what we want to make, while supporting each other creatively and financially.

We’re still in the early days, I'm still learning on how to be a better leader, and still figuring things out, but I’m incredibly excited about where things could go in 2026 and beyond.

# Conclusion

I really couldn’t be happier to wake up every day with the opportunity to work on my dreams. We’re still in the early stages of something that I genuinely believe could become special, and I want to do everything I can to make that a reality.

I don’t want a million dollars, and I don’t want to be the biggest thing in the world. All I want is to wake up each day, work on cool projects, spend time with awesome people, try new things, and not constantly worry about finances. The fact that much of this is already my reality means more to me than I can properly put into words.

I’d love to keep doing this for as long as possible. I currently have enough saved to keep going into early 2026, but the future is a bit uncertain. Depending on how the year goes, I may eventually need to slow down production.

If you enjoy what we do and would like to support us continuing to work independently, I have a Ko-fi page you can donate to. Please only consider supporting if you’re financially able and genuinely want to help. It truly means a lot either way.
